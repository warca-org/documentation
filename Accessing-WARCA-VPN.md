4. Connecting to VPN

Using your browser, navigate to https://connect.warca.net

If you are not currently logged in, it will redirect you yo 
https://iam.warca.net for authentication.

If you are using your PassKey for the first time with WARCA, you 
will be asked to bind your PassKey to your account. Currently, binding 
requires you to enter your username and password.

You will receive your username and password in separate message 
shortly. Once you PassKey is bound, you no longer have to use your 
username and password. Furthermore, your password will be disabled 
shortly after you bind your PassKey.

https://iam.wwpass.net may ask you to confirm access for VPN. 
Please accept.

One you successfully logged in, https://iam.wwpass.net will 
redirect you back to https://connect.warca.net. Some browsers may ask 
you to allow opening anyconnect://... URL scheme. You should allow this 
to connect.

AnyConnect client starts automatically and connects you to WARCA VPN.

Use AnyConnect UI to disconnect from VPN when needed.
